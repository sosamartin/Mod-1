They now serve 150 million consumers, 34 million of being in the US alone.

	They use JavaScript, Python, Node.js, React, TypeScript, Amazon EC2, GraphQL, React Native, AWS Lamba, Kafka, Scala, Erlang, Stack Overflow, Kubernets, Bitbucket, Sentry, AWS Elastic Load, Amazon CloudWatch, Data Dog

## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
	They have been able to stop millions of shoppers from using and having multiple credit cards for being able to buy the products they desire in that moment while being able to pay later.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?		Consumer use, Retention Rate, Revenue Growth, Market Share are just some of the most valuable metrics for these type of companies. Based on these Metrics Klarna has been doing a lot better this year as they found themselves taking a big hit the year prior. 
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
	PayPal is one of Klarna’s biggest competitors and based on consumer reviews they are performing better even if Paypal is not failing. Klarnas downside is not accepting purchases from customers who do not have good credit with them which will get them to instead use other platforms to still be able to get the wanted product. 

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)
	Klarna could be available in the real estate realm by maybe being able to help those falling behind in rent to cover the remaining cost to not fall in default or resulting in them being evicted.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
	To be able to get more consumer use on a monthly and long-term use and to be able to possibly also get their company to be able to invest in commercial real-estate deals later on to take over a new realm of becoming a home lender which is widely needed. They originally wanted to disrupt traditional banking systems, and this would push them in that direction even more. 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
	Collecting data from NHRA and FRA. Also using Mortgage technology that can digitize loan processing, appraisal management, and payments. 	
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
	They would have to be able to use censuses of specific regions to show the areas in which there are big turn arounds of people needed help with rent and areas that show where people need help in getting loans where they traditionally would get rejected from getting home loans.
